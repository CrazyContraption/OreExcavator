# OreExcavator
Ore Excavator is the 1.4 version of the 1.3 Veinminer mod for Terraria ModLoader, with a shared purpose.

Original concept by [NanobotZ](https://github.com/NanobotZ), all credit where it is due.

Ore Excavator exists not just as a port of the 1.3 mod, but serves to expand and adapt the abilities of the mod,
adding new 1.4 features in hopes to increase the quality of life elements it provided to the Terraria modding scene.

Ore Excavator, similar to its predecessor, will mine adjacent tiles, and walls of the same type with the initial action.
Ore Excavator adds chain-replacing, planting, painting, and other quality of life features within the 1.4 port of the mod.

Currently, the mod is closed access source, until such a time as community involvement is desired to take over the
mod as a community.
