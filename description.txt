Ore Excavator has become the offical 1.4 port of VeinMiner, with VeinMiner being discontinued, and merged into Ore Excavator with permission.

Just like with Minecraft's Ore Excavator, Ore Excavator aims to improve, expand, and adapt with the future of the modding community for the ultimate quality of life experience. Ore Excavator allows you to effortlessly mine groups of ores, walls, and perform many other tile manipulation features effortlessly at once, with plenty more to come before 1.0!

Credit to NanobotZ for the base code and the original concept!


FEATURES:
 - Mine adjacent tiles/walls from a single block
 - Vein-swap adjacent tiles/walls from a single block
 - Configurable whitelist & blacklist with block picker controls in-game
 - Fully configurable client controls and keybindings
 - Fully configurable client settings to tailor to dynamic performance needs
 - Fully threaded support
 - Autoswing enabled
 - Progression friendly
 - Powerful server management configurations
 - Full multiplayer support
 - Full modded support


!!! THIS IS AN ALPHA VERSION !!!
This is intended for early access users wishing to play on 1.4, and is likely to be broken several times!

I will do my best to ensure that the mod stays for compatible and issue updates as needed, especially for multiplayer.

Due to the nature of the mod, bugs involving deleting massive amounts of blocks, walls, and similar issues are to be expected.
